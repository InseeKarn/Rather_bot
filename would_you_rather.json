Alright, let's tackle this "Would you Rather" challenge. The user wants 12 original questions, each under 14 words, with a playful, surprising, and safe-for-ages-13+ tone. They also want a mix of topics like daily life, food, school, travel, habits, gadgets, social media, and superpowers. No violence, hate, sex, etc. Let me brainstorm some ideas.

First, I need to ensure each question is under 14 words. Let me start with daily life. Maybe something about chores versus doing nothing. Then food: maybe a twist on breakfast vs dinner. School could involve homework vs no school. Travel: maybe a funny scenario like a hotel vs a bus. Habits: like always keeping a planner or always being late. Gadget: charging by dancing vs jokes. Social media: maybe a funny prompt like commenting vs not. Superpowers: sneezing glitter vs hiccuping bubbles. Let me check each for originality and adherence to the rules. Avoid any repeated examples from the user. Let me count the words in each to make sure. Okay, that should cover a mix of topics. Now, structure them into a JSON array without numbers or prefixes. Make sure the language is playful and surprising. Alright, let's put it all together.
